To conduct AMR/U/C analysis following the One Health approach, we'll need references and resources from the World Health Organization (WHO) and related organizations. Below is a categorized list of references to collect::

## 1. WHO Guidelines and Manuals

### Human Antimicrobial Use (AMU)

#### WHO ATC/DDD Index
- **Purpose:** Provides the standard methodology for calculating Defined Daily Doses (DDDs).
- **Reference:** WHO ATC/DDD Index
- **Content:** Defined Daily Dose (DDD) values, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification codes.

#### Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (2015)
- **Purpose:** Framework for national action plans to combat AMR.
- **Content:** Strategies for AMR surveillance and AMU reporting in humans.

#### WHO Report on Surveillance of Antibiotic Consumption
- **Purpose:** Guidance for collecting and analyzing AMC data.
- **Content:** Includes AMC indicators, metrics, and examples from countries.

### Animal Antimicrobial Use (AMU)

#### WHO-FAO-OIE Tripartite Collaboration Documents
- **Purpose:** Framework for One Health collaboration.
- **Key Document:** Monitoring Global Progress on Addressing Antimicrobial Resistance: Tripartite AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey.
- **Content:** Guidelines for monitoring AMU in animals.

#### OIE Standards on Antimicrobial Use
- **Purpose:** Monitoring antimicrobial use in animals and standardizing reporting.
- **Reference:** OIE Antimicrobial Use

### Environmental AMR

#### WHO Guidance on Environmental AMR Surveillance
- **Purpose:** Guidance on monitoring AMR in environmental samples.
- **Content:** Sampling methods, analytical techniques, and reporting standards.

## 2. Surveillance Protocols

### AMR Surveillance

#### WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS)
- **Purpose:** Provides standards for AMR and AMU surveillance.
- **Reference:** GLASS
- **Content:** Data collection templates, resistance rate definitions, and methodology.

#### WHO Critically Important Antimicrobials (CIA) List
- **Purpose:** To prioritize antimicrobials for AMR surveillance.
- **Reference:** CIA List

### AMC Data Sources

#### WHO Essential Medicines List (EML)
- **Purpose:** Standardizes the classification of antimicrobials.
- **Reference:** WHO EML
- **Content:** List of essential antimicrobials and usage guidance.

#### WHO Methodology for Surveillance of National Antimicrobial Consumption
- **Purpose:** Methodology for AMC data collection and interpretation.
- **Reference:** AMC Methodology

## 3. Data Sources

### Human Health Data
- **National Health Information Systems (NHIS):** Patient consultations, prescriptions, and hospital admissions.
- **Global Burden of Disease (GBD):** For population health and disease burden data.

### Animal Health Data
- **Livestock Census Data:** For animal population and biomass calculations.
- **Feedlot and Veterinary Reports:** Antimicrobial usage and treatment data.

### Environmental Data
- **Environmental Monitoring Agencies:** Sampling data for antimicrobial residues and resistant bacteria.

## 4. Statistical and Data Analysis Guidelines

#### WHO Practical Manual on Statistical Methods for AMC and AMR
- **Purpose:** Guidance for calculating and interpreting AMC/AMR indicators.
- **Reference:** Includes GLASS and WHO-AMC reporting methodologies.

## 5. Training and Resources

#### WHO-AMR Surveillance Training Resources
- **Online courses and manuals on conducting AMR/AMU surveillance.**
- **WHO-AMR Training Portal**
